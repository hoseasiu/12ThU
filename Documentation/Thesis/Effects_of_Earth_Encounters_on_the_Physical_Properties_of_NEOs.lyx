\begin_layout Abstract
The effects of Earth encounters on the physical properties of near-Earth
 objects (NEOs) have been shown to be significant factors in their evolution.
 Previous studies have examined the effects of these encounters on reflectance
 spectra based on observational measurements, and effects such as spin state
 and shape changes have been studied in specific asteroids and in simulation.
 In this project, an automated light curve fitting routine was developed
 to support data reduction in an ongoing NEO survey.
 Additionally, data from previous NEO surveys were used to support simulation
 results by showing with a significant and highly differences between encounter
 and non-encounter populations' rotational frequency distributions, demonstratin
g that Earth encounters do have an effect on asteroid rotational frequencies
 by increasing the overall frequency as well as causing a wider distribution
 of frequencies when compared to non-encounter populations.
 These data were, however, unable to show any effect on asteroid shape brought
 on by planetary encounters.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The study of the physical properties of asteroids is a key part of how we
 can understand the properties of the early solar system and how it formed.
 Asteroids represent a remnant of material left over from the early history
 of solar system formation that is largely unaffected by the various surface
 and internal processes that have altered the material that makes up the
 planets.
 However, that is not to say that the properties of asteroids have remained
 completely unchanged.
 Various gravitational and solar interactions experienced by asteroids have
 shaped the development of their properties over time 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bottke2002overview"

\end_inset

.
 The diversity of asteroid properties and orbits and how they have changed
 make it so that an understanding of the asteroid population serves as a
 proxy for us to study the formation and evolution of the solar system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Near-Earth objects (NEOs) are a particularly interesting subset of the asteroid
 population.
 Earth encounters in particular can be a major contributor to the development
 of these objects if their orbits allow them to have such encounters.
 These encounters are known to affect the properties of NEOs through tidal
 effects.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

 showed that weathered surfaces of asteroids are `refreshed' upon an Earth
 encounter, causing less reddening to be observed than would otherwise be
 expected.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "richardson1998tidal"

\end_inset

 conducted numerical simulations which showed that the tidal forces encountered
 by Earth-crossing asteroids may cause mass shifting and removal during
 flybys, resulting in changes such as distortions, and formation of fragment
 trains and orbiting ejecta.
 Rotation on the asteroid Toutatis was studied by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "takahashi2013spin"

\end_inset

, who showed that there was a significant shift in rotational angular momentum
 during periodic Earth flybys.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To study asteroid properties such as rotation and shape, photometric light
 curves are generated after a period of observation, from which these properties
 may be extracted.
 A light curve is simply a plot of object magnitude over time.
 The magnitude seen in these light curves can vary due to changes in heliocentri
c and geocentric distance, rotation, and solar phase angle 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "harris1989photometric"

\end_inset

.
 The changes due to distance are generally removed during data reduction
 by using a `reduced magnitude' value, but the periodic changes in brightness
 due to rotation and phase angle yield important information regarding the
 physical properties of the asteroid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rotational periods may tell us about the structure and collision history
 of an asteroid, while light curve amplitudes may tell us about the shapes
 of asteroids.
 Most larger asteroids (0.15 km < D < 10 km) are thought to be `rubble piles'
 held together by self-gravity, since a spin rate barrier appears to exist,
 as larger asteroids are not observed to spin faster than this `barrier'
 rate 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "pravec2002asteroid"

\end_inset

.
 As spin states asymptotically approach rotation around the principal axis
 of maximum moment of inertia, asteroid light curves are expected to be
 at least double-peaked, with the exception of near-spherical or other degenerat
e cases.
 Light curve amplitudes are indicative of asteroid shapes because elongated
 asteroids may have greater variation between the least amount of light
 that it reflects and the most that it reflects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This thesis expands on the studies done on asteroid-Earth encounters by
 building a method for automatic light curve fitting from magnitude data
 and by examining the effects of Earth encounters on asteroid rotational
 periods and amplitudes- values that may be obtained from light curves.
 An automatic light curve fitting routine was developed for the ongoing
 Mission-Accessible Near-Earth Object Survey (MANOS), which began in the
 latter half of 2013.
 However, due to the timing of MANOS, there is not enough data produced
 by the fitting routine to support a significant analysis of Earth encounter
 effects.
 As such, data from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Minor Planet
 Center (MPC) were used in the analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To approximate the probability of Earth encounters, the minimum orbit intersecti
on distance (MOID) parameter was used.
 MOID is defined as the distance between the closest points of two bodies'
 osculating orbits.
 Here, MOID is a better parameter to use than the direct geometric distance
 between the Earth and the objects because the integration of an object's
 position in its orbit loses precision much faster than information about
 the orbit itself.
 This lends greater value to using MOID for timescales on the order of centuries
 or more.
 It is important to note, though, that MOID provides an estimate of the
 lower bound of the distance of an encounter.
 It does not guarantee that an encounter occurs, but simply suggests an
 increased likelihood with a lower value.
 Instantaneous MOID may be determined from the present-day orbital parameters
 of an object, and was used here to look at the relationship between encounters
 and period/amplitude.

The NEO Population
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Asteroids, comets, and large meteoroids whose orbit intersects or nearly
 intersects Earth's are classified as Near-Earth Objects (NEOs).
 These objects are typically divided into three major categories based on
 their orbital elements: the Aten, Apollo, and Amor groups, which are collective
ly known as the AAA asteroids 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "shoemaker1979earth"

\end_inset

.
 Atens are defined as objects having a semimajor axis 
\begin_inset Formula $a<1.0$
\end_inset

 and an aphelion distance 
\begin_inset Formula $Q\geq0.983$
\end_inset

 (the perihelion distance of Earth).
 This classification means that Aten objects only sometimes cross the orbit
 of Earth.
 Apollos are defined to have an 
\begin_inset Formula $a\geq1.0$
\end_inset

 and a perihelion distance 
\begin_inset Formula $q\leq1.0167$
\end_inset

 (the aphelion distance of Earth).
 Amors are defined solely by their perihelion distance, namely 
\begin_inset Formula $1.1067\leq q\leq1.3$
\end_inset

, meaning they are near-Earth-crossers but do not currently qualify as Earth-cro
ssing asteroids.
 An NEO is considered a potentially hazardous object (PHO) if its minimum
 orbit intersection distance (MOID) is less than 0.05 astronomical units
 (AU) and has an absolute magnitude of 22.0 or less 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "jpl2014NEO"

\end_inset

.
 Orbital perturbations may, naturally, change the classification of any
 particular NEO between these groups.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The orbital characteristics of NEOs generally mean that they stay as NEOs
 for at most a few million years, eventually crashing into the Sun or terrestria
l planets, or being flung out of the solar system 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "binzel2002physical"

\end_inset

.
 The fact that the number of NEOs has remained steady over the last 3 billion
 years suggests that there is a source of resupply for the population 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bottke2002overview"

\end_inset

.
 It is believed that main belt asteroids (MBAs) provide the bulk of NEO
 resupply, with Jupiter and Saturn resonances causing asteroids to move
 from main belt to NEO orbits.
 Smaller NEOs are likely collision fragments from MBAs, and exhibit younger
 (less-weathered) surfaces due to the difficulty of surviving further collisions
 or planetary encounters 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "binzel2002physical"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The NEO population is of special interest planetary astronomers because
 of its proximity to Earth.
 NEOs with low inclination and low eccentricity in particular are some of
 the best solar system targets for space missions due to the relatively
 low 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta V$
\end_inset

 (a measure of the amount of effort required to change trajectories) and
 short time frame required to reach them.
 Additionally, the inner solar system orbits and periodic proximity to Earth
 of these NEOs mean that thermal and power considerations for rendezvous
 and flyby missions can be significantly simplified compared to near-Sun
 or outer solar system missions, making them relatively low-cost and within
 the reach of early private-sector space missions

Planetary Encounters

\begin_layout Standard
Tidal forces encountered near the terrestrial planets cause a number of
 changes to asteroids.
 Distortion and disruption have been found to occur with Earth-crossing
 asteroids in numerical simulations, with results ranging from elongation
 and mass stripping, to the formation of fragment trains and binary systems.
 Low-inclination, low 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{\infty}$

 in these simulations

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 argues that large, monolithic MBAs may have been fragmented by collisions
 to form rubble piles.
 The lack of observed fast-rotating asteroids with absolute magnitudes 
\begin_inset Formula $H<22$
\end_inset

 suggests that larger NEOs are indeed such rubble piles and have minimal
 tensile strength, where any additional spin-up would cause disruption.
 Smaller NEOs, however, may remain monoliths due to the fact that they were
 spun off from these rubble piles.
 Fragment trains are generally formed from distortion processes that cause
 elongation, resulting in a pattern similar to what happened to Comet D/Shoemake
r-Levy 9 during its 1992 Jupiter encounter 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "shoemaker1979earth"

\end_inset

.
 Binary systems, on the other hand, are often formed from spin-up, which
 causes rubble pile asteroids to fling mass off their equators, resulting
 in an orbiting body.
 The fact that about half of the observed fast-rotating (
\begin_inset Formula $P<2.2\: h$
\end_inset

) NEOs are binary systems supports the idea that Earth encounters cause
 strong enough disruptions to form binary systems

Planetary encounters have also been shown to cause `freshening' of the surface
 of asteroids.
 This process runs counter to the usual 'space weathering' process whereby
 asteroids become increasingly reddened.
 Binzel et al.
 (2010) showed that Mars and Earth-crossing asteroids that have closer encounter
s with the terrestrial planets tend to appear less weathered.
 This investigation involved using the Minimum Orbit Intersection Distance
 (MOID) parameter as a measure of the possibility of an Earth encounter,
 showing that for an integrated MOID, objects that likely had planetary
 encounters over the past 500,000 years showed less signs of weathering
 than objects that were kept away from a planetary encounter (perhaps by
 orbital resonance)

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Numerical simulations across a distribution of asteroid spin states showed
 that while planetary encounters may cause either spin-up or spin-down or
 tumbling in individual asteroids, there is an overall trend towards spin-ups,
 one that is particularly prevalent for bodies with a slow initial rotation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "scheeres2004evolution"

\end_inset

.
 Tumbling cases may be created only if the flyby occurs out of the asteroid's
 equatorial plane, as gravitational forces along the plane would at most
 cause a spin-up or spin-down

Recently, radar imaging of 4179 Toutatis- an asteroid that makes periodic
 near-Earth flybys- gave a series of observations that showed terrestrial
 tidal torques altering the rotational dynamics of the asteroid.
 These torques mostly caused changes in orientation as the asteroid passed
 close to the Earth, but a particularly close encounter in 2004 demonstrated
 a significant perturbation in the angular momentum of the asteroid that
 persists to the present

Asteroid Surveys
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
New technologies have shifted the observing focus from larger, multi-kilometer-s
ized MBAs and NEOs to smaller sub-kilometer-sized NEOs.
 Asteroid surveys in the past have been able to find and characterize thousands
 of main-belt and near-Earth asteroids.
 Many past surveys focused on discovery, with examples including LONEOS,
 LINEAR, Catalina, and Pan-STARRS.
 Some studies were specifically for characterization of known objects, such
 as the albedo characterization done by IRAS, WISE and Akari, and the spectral
 characterization done by SMASS.
 These surveys were able to extensively sample the population of asteroids
 that is larger than the rubble pile limit; however technological limitations
 meant that they were biased towards being able to observe larger, brighter
 objects, rarely being able to resolve asteroids dimmer than 22nd absolute
 magnitude

The past decade has seen a rapid increase in the number of NEO detections,
 partly due to advances in observation and computing technologies, but also
 because of increased urgency started by a mandate by the American government
 to characterize 90% of NEOs larger than 1 km that may present an impact
 hazard to Earth 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "binzel2002physical"

\end_inset

.
 A new, multi-year program started in August of 2013 called the Mission
 Accessible Near-Earth Object Survey (MANOS) seeks to leverage advances
 in observing capabilities to characterize asteroid targets that are more
 than an order of magnitude smaller than those covered by previous studies.
 Using telescopes such as Gemini, SOAR, Kitt Peak 4m, and CTIO, MANOS is
 specifically focusing on sub-kilometer-sized targets that would be accessible
 by space missions utilizing conventional chemical propulsion, providing
 rough characterization of targeted NEOs via astrometry, light curves, and
 spectra.
 Mission-accessible is defined to be having a 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta V$
\end_inset

 < 7 km/s, which is the approximate limit of conventional chemical propulsion.
 The program aims to characterize approximately 100 NEOs per year, meaning
 that there will be a large throughput of data during the survey period,
 which is expected to last 3 to 5 years.
 This thesis draws much of its data from the MANOS dataset, and a part of
 the work done for the thesis was development of automated data processing
 software for the MANOS pipeline.

In order to automate part of the data processing done on incoming MANOS
 data, a fitting routine, manosCurveFit, was developed by the author to
 automatically scan reduced MANOS photometry data and convert them into
 a light curve model which provides the period and amplitude.
 Before this work, curve fitting for MANOS was done using software built
 on MATLAB, which contained some components that were relatively poorly
 documented and required a proprietary platform.
 Other common fitting methods, such as Canopus, were similarly based on
 proprietary software.
 manosCurveFit was developed from scratch specifically for the MANOS data
 pipeline and represents one of very few pieces of light curve fitting software
 that is free and open source, and possibly the only such software that
 is tailored for asteroid fits.

\begin_layout Standard
The fitting routine fits a mathematical model to light curve data.
 The fitting process may be generally divided into input, evaluation, and
 output portions.
 The inputs in parentheses are not required for the fitting to work, but
 a guess at the rotational period may significantly constrain the search
 space, and if data is taken over multiple nights and/or by different instrument
s, offsets are required to normalize the magnitudes to some baseline.
 A number of other inputs may also be supplied to constrain or expand the
 search space.
 These inputs may be supplied by the fitInfo file for each object.
 The light curve data is then read in from one or more text files with standardi
zed columns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two kinds of magnitude offsets are then applied: offsets by night/instrument,
 if provided, and a normalizing offset which subtracts the weighted average
 magnitude of the set from the entire set.
 The normalizing offset is necessary in order to center the data points
 on the y-axis for fitting purposes, and may be used in this context because
 only differential magnitudes are needed.
 This acts as a coarse adjustment for y-axis centering.
 A finer adjustment is made by a y-axis offset for the model, which is taken
 to be part of the least squares minimization.
 For each period to be checked, a least squares minimization is performed
 for each order of Fourier coefficients from two to six, unless specified
 otherwise in the fitInfo file.
 The parameters that generate the best fit to the data are kept and printed
 at the end, along with the light curve and residual plots.

 is the time of the

 In the context of NEOs, the phase angle may very well change, particularly
 as targets pass very close to Earth.
 However, the majority of MANOS targets will be observed for a short period
 of time (on the order of a few hours) and characterization of these targets
 will be done solely on the basis of a one-time observation.
 Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 will be assumed to be a constant due to the time scales involved in the
 single observation, and as such, manosCurveFit does not take phase angles
 into account.

By default, the program will run the fit from 
\begin_inset Formula $m=2$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $m=6$

.
 The minimum of order two is due to the fact that asteroid light curves
 are expected to be double-peaked (except for some cases of complex rotation
 or degenerate cases of near-spherical bodies), and the maximum of order
 six is used to prevent over-fitting.
 The curve is centered around zero magnitude by a weighted average of the
 data, but since there is often still a slight magnitude offset due to the
 nonuniform nature of the sampling, a magnitude offset parameter was added
 to allow for a better fit.
 The user does not normally interact with the optimization of this y-shift
 parameter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Precautions were taken to prevent over fitted or unsubstantiated models.
 Any models which produce amplitudes greater than 2 are rejected.
 This is necessary to prevent the fit from assuming a model in which the
 data are a small portion of a much longer period with one or more large
 spikes where data is not present.
 As an additional precaution, if the fitted period is more than 25% of the
 range of the phase-folded data points, a warning is given to notify the
 user of a potentially under-constrained model.

 The bottom sub-plot of Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:fitPlot"

\end_inset

 is an optional plot which shows the residuals of the generated fit.
 This plot may be used as an additional manual check on the fit by seeing
 if any structure or bias remains in the residuals, which may indicate that
 a higher-order fit is required.
 Additionally, any significant magnitude bias in the residuals plot may
 indicative of an incorrect offset of a particular night, if multiple nights'
 data are used (this effect should also be viable in the main fitted plot).
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:residualsPlot"

\end_inset

 shows the RMS values of different periods that were attempted during the
 fitting process, with the fit that provided the minimum RMS value representing
 the fit that was eventually accepted.
 These figures represent a set of data that was composed of 12 nights, split
 into two input text files, all of which were automatically merged and processed
 by the program.
 This kind of dataset is more complex than most typical MANOS datasets,
 which will generally be data from a few hours on one instrument for a single
 night, so multiple input files and automatic merging will largely be unnecessar
y.

Overview and Hypothesis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NEO light curve frequencies, light curve amplitudes, and absolute magnitudes
 were compared to their MOID values.
 Data analysis sought to find differences in the distribution of these values
 over selected subsets, leveraging the aggregated values of groups of NEOs
 to look for trends in the overall data.
 Since MOID presents only a lower bound of the actual intersection distance,
 a small MOID does not guarantee that an object actually passed near the
 Earth, but rather only increases the likelihood that it did.
 A trend in the properties of the distribution within these groupings with
 respect to MOID would be a possible indicator an Earth encounter effect.
 The focus of the comparison is between objects that may have had an Earth
 encounter, and those that have not.
 A rough boundary for a MOID that is indicative of a possible Earth encounter
 is a value of <0.0026 AU, or <1 lunar distance (LD).
 Thus, this boundary was used to separate the asteroid population into two
 groups: a < 1 LD group that may have had an Earth encounter, and a > 1
 LD group that is extremely unlikely to have had an Earth encounter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the literature review presented in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "sec:Planetary-Encounters"

\end_inset

- particularly the simulations of Earth encounters done in

key "scheeres2000effects"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "scheeres2004evolution"

\end_inset

- it is hypothesized that a population of objects that have undergone a
 planetary encounter will likely have greater variation in rotational period
 and amplitude.
 This variation is, however, unlikely to be very pronounced, as the limitations
 of MOID mean populations with some, but not all, objects that have had
 some Earth encounter is the best that can be selected.
 Again noting the simulations done by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "scheeres2004evolution"

\end_inset

, it is hypothesized that the analysis may show a slight spin-up in objects
 that have had planetary encounters, but this again will likely prove difficult
 to show (perhaps only showing possible statistical significance in some
 cases, and no statistical significance) because the simulations showed
 that spin-up is a prominent effect only in asteroids with initially slow
 rotations, which cannot be distinguished in the data being used.

Description of NEO Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two main sources of data were polled for the analysis done in this project.
 The Jet Propulsion Laboratory's (JPL) Horizons database was polled for
 MOID, magnitude, and rotational period (but did not contain light curve
 amplitude information).
 Two databases were taken from the Minor Planet Center (MPC)- one of light
 curve and one of NEOs- and combined to obtain MOID, magnitude, rotational
 period, and amplitude information.
 The MOID values from both sources were instantaneous MOIDs calculated from
 the present-day orbital elements.
 The Horizons dataset contained 10938 objects, 10775 of which contained
 both magnitude and MOID information, 685 of which contained both rotational
 period and MOID information, and 680 of which contained all three.
 The analysis done for rotational frequency was done using the Horizons
 data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The MPC's NEO datasets contained information for 827 Aten, 5306 Apollo,
 and 4500 Amor objects when it was polled for this project in March of 2014,
 while the light curve database contained 2326 objects.
 The light curve database had the amplitude and period information for each
 object, but lacked MOID data, which was contained in the NEO dataset.
 As such, it was necessary to merge the two sets, cross-referencing objects
 contained in both to obtain a complete listing of light curve properties
 and MOID.
 The resulting set contained 274 objects, of which 245 contained amplitude,
 magnitude, and MOID information.
 Since this dataset contained light curve amplitude values, it was used
 for the amplitude analysis.

However, it may be seen from Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 that objects that have higher magnitudes (likely to be smaller objects)
 tend to display faster rotations, which is consistent with the asteroid
 collision evolution model predicted by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "chapman1978asteroid"

\end_inset

.
 This makes the result given by Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Moving-average-plot"

\end_inset

 less reliable, since it is likely to be biased by the fact that dimmer
 asteroids are more likely to be observed closer to Earth (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Semilog-scatterplot-of"

\end_inset

), and these dimmer asteroids are likely to be smaller and therefore have
 higher rotational frequencies (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:magVsFreq"

\end_inset

).
 In order to better examine the distribution of rotation frequencies as
 a function of MOID, a correction must be made for this size/rotation bias.
 Thus, when analyzing the frequency distributions, only objects within a
 certain range of magnitudes were compared to each other.

\begin_layout Standard
A two-sample one-tailed Student's t-test was conducted to see if there was
 a statistically significant difference between the means of the rotational
 frequencies of objects in the MOID range where planetary encounters are
 possible and other MOID ranges, specifically if the frequencies in the
 group that had smaller MOID values were greater than the frequencies of
 the group with larger MOID values.
 Similarly, a two-sample one-tailed f-test was conducted to see if there
 was a statistically significant variance between the rotation frequencies
 of different populations, specifically if the variance of the frequencies
 in the group that had smaller MOID values was greater than the variance
 seen in the group with larger MOID values.
 The two samples for each test were binned according to a dividing MOID
 value, for which one sample ranges from 0 to the dividing MOID, and the
 other ranges from the dividing MOID to the maximum MOID value in the data
 set (174 LD).
 Dividing MOID values were chosen to range from 1 to 10 LD, since objects
 crossing within 1 LD are likely to have experienced some encounter effect,
 and the inverse square drop-off of gravity means that at 10 LD, the effect
 of gravity is one one-hundredth of its effect at 1 LD, meaning all asteroids
 with some planetary encounter effect should have been captured in the first
 bin by the time the dividing MOID is at 10 LD.
 The sizes of the groupings are shown in Tables

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "tab:Number-of-objects-25-30"

\end_inset

 where 174 LD represents the MOID of the furthest object in the dataset.
 The results of the t-tests and f-tests are shown in Figures

, where p values lower than 0.1, 0.05, and 0.01 represent possibly significant,
 significant, and highly significant differences between the two samples.

Amplitude
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Light curve amplitude was also examined as an asteroid property using a
 procedure similar to the one done for rotational frequency.
 When examining a light curve, the amplitude is the difference in magnitude
 between the maximum observed brightness and the minimum observed brightness
 in curve.
 Amplitude is indicative of asteroid shape, since elongated shapes will
 produce larger variations in brightness when spinning along a principal
 axis of maximum moment of inertia.
 In these cases, the objects will be brighter to an observer when their
 elongated side is reflecting the most light towards Earth, and dimmest
 when their shorter sides are reflecting the most light.
 There may be, of course, cases of elongated asteroids spinning along their
 long axes, but these cases are unlikely due to the tendency of spin states
 to evolve towards axes of maximum moments of inertia due to their lower
 energy states.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amplitude bias correction was performed using the procedure described in
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "binzel1992trojan"

\end_inset

.
 This procedure was used to correct for a bias introduced by possible under
 sampling of light curves, which would generate a lower estimate of the
 amplitude.
 The procedure attempts to bring the amplitude estimate as close as possible
 to what it would be if the object was observed at a 
\begin_inset Formula $60^{\circ}$

 phase angle.

Again, the property being examined was plotted against the object magnitude
 to check for correlation to see if the population needed to be subdivided
 to eliminate a magnitude bias.
 In this case, however, it may be seen in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 that such a correlation does not exist for amplitude, so the kind of de-biasing

Finally, a two-sample one-tailed t and f-tests were conducted, using a MOID
 value ranging from 1 to 10 LD as the dividing value between the two samples.

 that is more likely to have experienced an Earth encounter, and the sample

Rotational Frequency
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:statsTestsRot20-25"

\end_inset

, it can be seen that from the sample of objects that range from 20th to
 25th magnitude, results of all the f-tests for pairs of samples divided
 by MOID values ranging from 1 to 10 LD all show a highly statistically
 significant difference in variance, indicating that populations of objects
 that have had a planetary encounter have a higher variance in rotational
 frequencies than those that did not.
 Similarly, all of the t-tests return significant or highly significant
 differences, indicating that the set of objects with lower MOID had higher
 rotational frequencies than the set with lower MOID.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the sample of objects that range from 25th to 30th magnitude, the majority
 of results from both t and f-tests return some statistical significance,
 there is a noticeable jump in p values for both tests when the bin division
 line is between 2 and 5 LD.
 However, the quality of these results is rather low once the dividing point
 is past 2 LD, since the number of objects in the further bin drops significantl
y, as can be seen in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Number-of-objects-25-30"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The larger sample size and range of MOIDs present in the 20-25th magnitude
 group makes it a more reliable group for statistical testing.
 With the brightness (size) to spin rate bias largely removed by restricting
 the samples to a small magnitude range in both cases, these results confirm
 the hypothesis that populations which experience near-Earth encounters
 see both a increased variation in rotational frequency, as well as an overall
 increase in the frequencies.
 The statistical tests returned more significant results than were predicted
 on both counts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Light Curve Amplitude
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data do not support the hypothesis that light curve amplitude is affected
 by near-Earth encounters.
 As noted in the hypothesis, this is a particularly difficult phenomenon
 to show, since the effect only occurs with very close encounters and/or
 larger rubble piles.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Number-of-objects-amp"

\end_inset

 shows that the number of objects in the 0 to 2 LD MOID range is actually
 smaller than the typical minimum sample size of 30 for statistical analysis,
 which means that there simply is not enough information on low-MOID objects
 to conduct a proper analysis in the region where the amplitude effect is
 expected to be most easily observable.
 Supplementing the existing data with incoming MANOS data would likely improve
 the situation, but is outside the scope of this project.

\begin_layout Section
Light Curve Fitting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A number of improvements have been identified for manosCurveFit, largely
 to expand the kinds of inputs that the program can take, and partly to
 improve the fitting routine directly.
 Currently, the inputs for manosCurveFit can only be floats.
 It would be useful to expand the inputs to include strings, as many data
 files use strings to represent properties such as filter types and instruments,
 which currently are not accounted for in the data that is read into the
 program.
 Another improvement involves cases when data from multiple nights or telescopes
 are used.
 In these cases, an offset must be provided to each night except for one
 to bring all the magnitudes to the same baseline.
 However, in some cases, it would be easier to leave the offsets as a free
 parameter that can be optimized for in the same way as the other free parameter
s, which eliminates the need to estimate the offsets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, to account for cases when multiple nights' data are used in which
 the nights are spread further apart (currently not the case with MANOS),
 phase angle considerations may be added to the fitting routine.
 To do this, orbital parameters must be known for the objects being analyzed.
 Since the fitting code is primarily operated on computers at Lowell Observatory
, it would make sense to have it poll Lowell's databases for orbital parameters
 once the proper infrastructure is in place for such a system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Data Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additional analysis can be done to improve the work done in this project.
 As previously mentioned, the dataset could be supplemented by MANOS, which
 would fill in gaps in the data, particularly on high-magnitude, close-range
 objects.
 Integrated MOID would also likely prove to be a useful way to look at the
 data.
 Integrated MOID provides a more accurate picture of the likelihood of planetary
 encounters by integrating the orbit of an object (along with a number of
 virtual clones of the object offset by some distance) back in time, generally
 providing lower MOID bounds than an instantaneous calculation from present-day
 parameters would give.
 This method was used by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "binzel2010earth"

\end_inset

 to show the asteroid `freshening' effect of near-Earth encounters, and
 would likely prove useful here as well.
 Finally, as a comparison to a population of asteroids for which planetary
 encounters are even less likely than high-MOID NEOs, populations that are
 likely to have had encounters could be compared to main belt equivalent
 asteroids.
 In this case, NEOs could be grouped by absolute magnitude and compared
 to main belt asteroids of similar magnitudes to see the difference when
 compared to a more `pristine' sample.

manosCurveFit Input, Evaluation, and Output Methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The software handles data input by reading text files and storing user-defined
 data columns as numpy arrays in a 
\shape italic
lightCurveData
\shape default
 object.
 Evaluation is handled by the 
\shape italic
fitData 
\shape default
function, which utilizes 
\shape italic
lmfit
\shape default
's minimization routine with free parameters given as Parameter object inputs.
 Output is handled by the 
\shape italic
outputResults
\shape default
 function, which has options to display results in various ways.
